### 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a learner of the **ALX Software Engineering** program and I want to revamp my GitHub Profile to make it stand out from the crowd in my job search.

🌟 I started software engineering because:  
> *"I love solving real-world problems with smart, efficient tools. Learning how systems talk to each other fascinates me!"*

🧠 I’m passionate about:  
- Creating simple tools that make life easier  
- Learning by doing (hands-on practice & challenges)  
- Contributing to impactful open-source communities

🎯 **My Vision:**  
> To become a creative and technically sound backend engineer who builds meaningful digital solutions.

🔧 **I want to work on:**  
- CLI tools  
- REST APIs  
- Automations & shell scripting  
- Small but useful backend utilities
